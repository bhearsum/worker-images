# Worker Images
This repository stores the code used to create a machine image for use in [Taskcluster](https://github.com/taskcluster). This repository calls a [Powershell Packer Provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/provisioners/powershell) to configure the machine image using [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/puppet_index.html).
